# Personal Home Cloud with Secure Multi-Level Access

Domain: Systems & Networking

1. Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive design for a secure, self-hosted cloud server based at home. The system provides role-based access to personal and family data, ensuring that different users have customized levels of access appropriate for them. The entire system is designed to be securely exposed to the internet, allowing for safe remote access from anywhere in the world.

2. Core Features

The design of this home cloud server includes the following core features as specified in the problem statement:

    Home Cloud Server & Segmentation: A self-hosted storage server that segments access by different user types such as self, family, and guests.

    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): A robust permission system ensures that each family member can only access their relevant folders and data.

    Guest Access Portal: Provides restricted and time-bound access for temporary users, like visiting family or friends.

    Network Security Controls: The system is protected with essential security measures including firewalls, VPN access, and device authentication.

    Data Encryption & Monitoring: All stored data is encrypted, network traffic is secured, and the system includes monitoring tools to detect suspicious activity.

    Secure Remote Access: The cloud is exposed to the internet securely using a combination of VPN and HTTPS for worldwide accessibility.

    Centralized Backend Management: A central panel is included for managing user policies, sessions, and access control.

3. Technology Snapshot

This solution is designed around a core of robust and open-source technologies:

    Core Software: Nextcloud on Ubuntu Server

    Network Security: WireGuard (VPN) & UFW (Firewall)

    Remote Access: Nginx Proxy Manager & DuckDNS

4. Detailed Design
